
     Create an abstract class Shape with following data member and methods- 
     Create data members for height and width.
     Create constructor and assign local varaible values to instance varaibles 
     Create methods for finding area and perimeter.
     Create three subclasses Square, Rectangle and EquilateralTriangle that extends Shape class and define both the methods.
     Write a program that will find the area and perimeter of 3 Shapes and print the details for all. 
     Prompt the user for the  values to be input from the terminal.
 
     Sample Input:
     Enter Width of Rectangle in meters
     10
     Enter Length of Rectangle in meters
     5
     Enter width of Equilateraltriangle
     15
     Enter radius of circle
     60
     Expected Output:
     Rectangle width: 10.0 meters and length: 5.0 meters
     Resulting area: 50.0 square meters
     Resulting perimeter: 30.0 meters 
     EquiTriangle side: 15.0meters
     Resulting area: 97 square meters
     Resulting perimeter: 45.0 meters 
     Circle radius : 60.0meters
     Resulting area: 11310 square meters
     Resulting perimeter: 377 meters  


class Shape: 
        // declare height and width variables
       // create construtor and Assign height and width to instance varaibles
       // create a methods to print height and width
  
//Add Square class that extends Shape class
class Square:
       // add methods to find area and perimeter of Square

//Add Rectangle class that extends Shape class
class Rectangle:
            // add methods to find area and perimeter of Rectangle

//Add EquilateralTriangle class that extends Shape class
class EquilateralTriangle
            // add methods to find area and perimeter of EquilateralTriangle
